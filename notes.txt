======================== maven wildfly plugin ==================
mvn clean compile package wildfly:deploy
mvn wildfly:undeploy
mvn clean compile package wildfly:redeploy

============= overview =================
1. Generate Web application
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=cohort10.sys.school -DartifactId=Cohort10School -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false

2. packaged web application to .war (web archive) -- this is waht is deployable in application server (wildfly)
mvn clean compile package

3. We uploaded the web archive into wildfly through the admin console......

======= Overview of HTTP ========================
-Any application main aim is to work on data(Message), the data message can exchanged two application within the same device
or different devices.
-For different applications to communicate, they must understand each other....setup rules/guidelines of communication.
-Protocol - is format in which data must be in for data transmitted

OSI MODEL
application layer protocols (http [text in format]) -->
presentation layer protocol (ssl [certificate - encrypts/decrypts) -->
Session Layer(group related request/response) -->
Transport Layer protocol(TCP - handshake-connection established by both the client and the server agrees to do communication) -->
Network layer protocol (IP - address of location) -->
Data link (packaging of data for transmission- frames) -->
Physical layer -- Network cables, wifi - radio waves

================= HTTP ======
Hypertext Transfer Protocol - Tim Berners 1990

1. has a text format called html (hypertext markup language)
2. protocol to exchange data/message (http)
3. client (requester, e.g browser through the url) and server (responder e.g web server)

the client(browser...firefox) makes a request(html) to the server(web server...wildfly),
the server(wildfly) receives the request, processes message and responds to the client (html).
client (browser) receives message the displays the message for the user.

How it works
____________

Scenario 1
client(browser)--request-->Server(wildfly - servlet)
client(browser)<--response--Server(wildfly - servlet)

Scenario 2
client(browser)--request-->Server(wildfly - servlet)
Server(wildfly - servlet)--request-->Database //notice the server is now client to the database
Server(wildfly - servlet)<--response--Database
client(browser)<--responds--Server(wildfly - servlet)

Scenario 3
client(browser)--request-->Server(wildfly - servlet)
Server(wildfly - servlet)--request-->Server2 //notice the server is now client to the database
Server(wildfly - servlet)<--response--Server2
client(browser)<--responds--Server(wildfly - servlet)


1. Client - any application/tool/software that request for services from a server on behalf of user. (e.g Browser, whatsapp, outlook)
    -Http client must understand html - we can manipulate html through css and javascript - (css and javascript will simply
        translate to html) to achieve dynamic html...
2. Server - a program that serves a client with a document (html), therefore http server,
    serves http client with http document (html).

BASICS CHARACTERISTICS ON HTTP
1. Simple
2. extensible
3. stateless - requests are not linked, but not sessionless

COMPONENTS OF HTTP
    1. HTTP MESSAGE  --- text in some format
    2. HTTP METHODS -- verbs/nouns on how the message is sent/received - post,get,put,delete,head,options

   GET - get information from the server to the client, get data is sent together with the url, get data is in the url...
   POST - the data is sent differently the with url, the data hidden in the url.
   PUT - updates while post creates
   DELETE - remove or delete
   HEAD - provides metadata/information about request/response
   OPTIONS - *********

   HTTP STATUS
    200 - ok
    404 - not found - that resource not available
    500 - server encountered unrecoverable error

//************************** SERVLET ***********
Servlet is a java program in JVM that translates http

How do you make a class to become a Servlet?
The class must implement directly or indirectly Servlet API (Application Programming Interface)
Servlet APIs is a collection of interfaces(contract/rules) that a class must
    follow(must implement) in order to server Http request

Servlet API are in package call javax.servlet
The interface that must be implement directly or indirectly is javax.servlet.Servlet

Servlet Container (wildfly, apache tomcat, glassfish e.t.c) - web application server that servers servlet....
Servlet Interface Methods:

lifecycle - creation to destruction

1. void init(ServletConfig config) - called by servlet container, to indicate that the servlet is placed into service
    Servlet container (wildfly) is starting up or when the application is deployed...
    It is called once in the lifecycle of a servlet - called once

2. ServletConfig getServletConfig() - Loads servlet configurations set in deployment descriptor (web.xml) - called once

3. void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException - called when a request
     is made, serves the request with content. It can be multiple time..., its whenever request and handles the request
     Whenever a request by the client(browser), the servlet container (wildfly) will automatically initialize
     ServletRequest req - with request information, ServletResponse res - response information

4. void destroy() - called by servlet container, to indicate that the servlet is destroyed
        Servlet container (wildfly) is shutting down or when the application is undeployed...
        It is called once in the lifecycle of a servlet

Note:  implement a servlet by extending abstract javax.servlet.GenericServlet, another way

Note: implement a servlet by extending abstract javax.servlet.HttpServlet, another way

===============================Servlet Lifecycle================
1. Servlet Loading - Servlet Container load all servlet, jvm - once
2. Servlet Instance Creation - once
3. init() method is invoked - once
4. service() method is called on request - done severally
5. destroy() method is invoked - once


============= Deployment Descriptor (web.xml) ===============
- is a java web application configuration file that tells to
    the servlet container(wildfly) how the application should be deployed
- web.xml it as xml.
-what does web.xml provide
    1. Servlet Declaration -- Declaring servlet
        *specify the order of servlet initialization
    2. Servlet Mapping -- maps servlet to url etc
    3. Pass Parameters to a servlet

================= HttpServletRequest Object ===============
- This is an object that is initialized automatically by the container whenever a request is made
    to a servlet

================= HttpServletResponse Object ===============
- Assignment work with http servlet.......
